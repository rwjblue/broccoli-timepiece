# Broccoli Timepiece

It's what you use to watch things, you know?

## Usage

Uses the standard `broccoli` watcher to build a tree (from the `Brocfile.js` in your projects root), and output to a directory.

Pass the name of the directory to output to as the first commandline parameter.

```bash
broccoli-timepiece dist/
```
